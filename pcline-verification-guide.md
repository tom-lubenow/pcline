# PCline Verification Guide

This guide provides methods to verify that PCline operates with the security enhancements as designed, focusing on confirming the absence of telemetry, external connections, and limiting API providers to LiteLLM only.

## Network Connection Verification

### Method 1: Network Monitoring

Use network monitoring tools to verify PCline's network activity:

1. **Installation**:
   - For macOS: Install [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) or use the built-in Activity Monitor (Network tab)
   - For Windows: Install [Glasswire](https://www.glasswire.com/) or use Resource Monitor
   - For Linux: Use `tcpdump`, `wireshark`, or `nethogs`

2. **Baseline Capture**:
   - Start your monitoring tool
   - Take a baseline capture of network activity before launching VSCode with PCline

3. **Test Procedure**:
   - Launch VSCode with PCline
   - Create a new task and interact with the extension
   - Use code analysis and AI assistant features
   - Check task history and various UI interactions

4. **Expected Results**:
   - No connections to `posthog.com`
   - No connections to `api.cline.bot`
   - No connections to Firebase services (`firebase.com`, `firebaseio.com`, etc.)
   - No connections to Cline authentication services
   - Connections only to your configured LiteLLM endpoints

### Method 2: Proxy Inspection

Set up a debugging proxy to inspect all HTTP/HTTPS traffic:

1. **Installation**:
   - Install [Proxyman](https://proxyman.io/) (macOS), [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) (Windows), or [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) (cross-platform)
   - Configure the proxy and install certificates

2. **Test Procedure**:
   - Configure VSCode to use your proxy
   - Perform the same test actions as in Method 1
   - Inspect all HTTP/HTTPS requests

3. **Expected Results**:
   - Only API requests to your configured LiteLLM endpoint
   - No outbound telemetry or analytics data
   - No authentication or account requests

### Method 3: Offline Testing

Verify that PCline functions properly without internet access:

1. **Test Procedure**:
   - Disconnect your computer from the internet or set up a firewall rule to block VSCode
   - Allow connections only to your LiteLLM server (if using a local server)
   - Launch VSCode and use PCline

2. **Expected Results**:
   - PCline should initialize without errors
   - UI should load properly
   - You should be able to interact with the extension
   - If a local LiteLLM server is configured, you should be able to use PCline's features

## Telemetry Code Verification

Verify that telemetry code has been properly neutralized:

### Check Telemetry Service Stubs

1. Open `src/services/telemetry/TelemetryService.ts`
2. Verify that:
   - The implementation is the stub version with empty methods
   - No actual data collection or transmission occurs
   - `isTelemetryEnabled()` always returns `false`

### Check Conversation Telemetry

1. Open `src/services/telemetry/ConversationTelemetryService.ts`
2. Verify that:
   - `isOptedInToConversationTelemetry()` always returns `false`
   - No OpenTelemetry initialization or data transmission occurs

## API Provider Verification

Confirm that only LiteLLM is available and functioning:

### Check API Integration

1. Open `src/api/index.ts`
2. Verify that `buildApiHandler` only returns LiteLLM handler 
3. Check that the handler is properly initialized with your configuration

### Test LiteLLM Integration

1. Configure PCline with your LiteLLM endpoint
2. Create a test task
3. Verify that the response comes through correctly
4. Check the Network tab in Developer Tools to confirm the request went only to your LiteLLM endpoint

## Content Security Policy Verification

Verify that the Content Security Policy blocks unauthorized connections:

1. Open Developer Tools in VSCode (Help > Toggle Developer Tools)
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Load PCline and perform some interactions
4. Look for any blocked requests in the consoleâ€”these would indicate attempts to connect to unauthorized domains

## External Features Verification

Confirm that external integrations have been properly disabled:

### Authentication Check

1. Look for "Sign in" or account-related UI elements
2. Verify they have been removed or disabled
3. Check that login endpoints are not being called

### Marketplace Check

1. Look for MCP marketplace UI elements
2. Verify they have been removed or disabled
3. Confirm no marketplace API calls are made

## Final Security Audit

For a comprehensive verification, perform these additional checks:

1. **Code Search**:
   - Search the codebase for remaining references to `posthog`, `firebase`, and `api.cline.bot`
   - Verify that these are either removed or stubbed out

2. **Extension Settings**:
   - Check that telemetry settings are fixed to "disabled"
   - Verify that no external service configurations are available

3. **Local Storage**:
   - Examine VSCode's global state storage for PCline
   - Verify no sensitive or identifying information is being persisted

## Troubleshooting

If you detect unexpected network connections:

1. Check the destination and payload of the requests
2. Review the corresponding code in PCline
3. Apply additional modifications as needed
4. Re-verify after changes

Remember that some features, like using online LiteLLM servers, will naturally require network connectivity. The goal is to ensure that *only* the explicitly configured endpoints are contacted and no additional telemetry or data collection occurs.
